# Maze Game


This maze game, implemented using Unity, takes advantage of random number generation and a binary tree algorithm in order to ensure that every run will produce a different maze with a unique solution. The player is able to move and change directions using the keys displayed on the screen. When the player moves, a trail is left behind, so the player is able to see the previous paths they have tried.

If the player hits one of the walls, an error sound will be generated. When the player reaches the end of the maze, a victory sound will be generated as well.

The appeal of the simplicity of the game is that the "theme" is easily changed. Provided is the code for the "beach" theme, with a blue background, sand colored maze, and red beach ball trail, along with the "forest" theme, with a brown background, green maze, and an apple trail.
